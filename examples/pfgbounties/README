This subdirectory contains information about some conjectures that
have a bounty of some Proofgold bars as of September 2023.  The bounty
can be collected by either proving the conjecture or proving the
negated conjecture. The first class of problems are the "randomly
generated" bounty propositions in the HF theory during the first six
months of Proofgold. To prove these (or their negation), megalodon
needs to be given the -hf command line argument.  All the remaining
classes are in the default HOTG (Egal Style) theory and no special
command line argument is required.

The collection is not exhaustive. To get the current list of bounties
use the "reportbounties" command in a Proofgold client.  As of
September 2023, there is a total of 9190 propositions with bounties
with the total amount of bounties just over 281,000 Proofgold bars.
The problems described below correspond to roughly 72% of the
outstanding bounties. Some information about the other bounties can be
found by reading through the archive of the old Proofgold forum
available at

https://prfgld.github.io/forum

* Randomly Generated

The first 5000 Proofgold blocks automatically placed a bounty of 25
bars on a randomly generated proposition. 3035 of these 5000 bounties
are still unclaimed, for a total of 75,875 bars (about 27% of the
outstanding bounties).  Most of the randomly generated propositions
with unclaimed bounties (of 25 bars each) are in the file
RandomlyGenerated.mg.

To prove one of these, create a separate file (mysoln.mg) copying the
proposition over (with its context, meaning declarations in the
relevant section).  Then fill in the proof and create a Proofgold
document:

megalodon -hf -owned ownedNov222023 -I PfgPreambleSep2020.mgs mysoln.mg > mysoln.pfg.

The problems are classified into the following categories: Random1,
Random2, Random3, QBF, HOSetConstr (Set Constraints), HOUnif (HO
Unification) CombUnif (Untyped Combinator Unification), AbstrHF
(Abstract HF), AIM1 and AIM2 (AIM Conjecture) and DiophantineMod and
Diophantine. For more information, see

Brown, Kaliszyk, Gauthier, Urban "Proofgold: Blockchain for Formal Methods" FMBC 2022

25 of the propositions are missing from RandomlyGenerated.mg (23 of
HOUnif and 2 of HOSetConstr), probably due to a bug with the Proofgold
code that generates the wrong formula in Megalodon format. To claim
any of those 25 bounties, the correct proposition would first need to
be determined, presumably using Proofgold or its code.

There are also 1183 variants of the randomly generated AIM problems
with bounties of 26 bars each, for a total of 30758 bars, about 11% of
the outstanding bounties.  These variants are in
RandomlyGeneratedAIMVariants.mg.

* Ramsey Problems

There are 67 Ramsey Theory problems with bounties, some of which
correspond to open mathematics problems.  The specific propositions
and more information is in RamseyConjsWithBounties.mg.  These bounties
are a total of about 32,300 bars, roughly 11.5% of the outstanding bounties.

In some cases, the bounty can be proven by appropriately translating
a counterexample into a proof. A source for such counterexamples is here:

* Mizar CNF problems

Bounties are on 1420 problems derived from Mizar theorems.  Most of
the bounties are (just under) 25 bars, but seven are (just under) 50
bars, for a total of about 35,675 bars.  (As of September 2023, this
makes these problems about 12.7% of the value of the outstanding
bounties.)  These are all simple first-order problems and are very
likely to be provable.

* Conjectures from Generalized Subgoals of Proofs

1161 of the 23,257 conjectures in

UpToOctonions/Nov2021ConjsAll.mg

have bounties of about 25 bars each. The total of the bounties is
about 29,025 bars, forming roughly 10% of the outstanding bounties.
The propositions are listed here with information about the bounties
in Nov2021ConjsWithBounties.mg.

* OEIS - https://github.com/ai4reason/oeis-mgpg1000

1000 conjectures are about proving the equality of two
functions that appear to compute the same OEIS sequence.
Each of the 1000 conjectures has a bounty of 1 bar, about 0.35%
of the total outstanding bounties.

The 1000 are combined into the file OEIS1000.mg, with each
conjecture in its own section. If you wish to prove one of them,
copy the section into its own file. The full file (which currently
has no proofs) can be checked as follows:
