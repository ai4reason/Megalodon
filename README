Megalodon is an open source interactive theorem prover and proof checker.
Its main application is to create Proofgold documents (proofgold.org).
It currently supports four Proofgold theories:

Egal: Higher order Tarski-Grothendieck Set Theory (using Egal's axioms).
  (see Brown, Pak "A Tale of Two Set Theories" CICM 2019)

Mizar: Higher order Tarski-Grothendieck Set Theory (using Mizar's axioms).
  http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~chad/pfgmizar.pdf

HF: Higher order theory of hereditarily finite sets
  http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~chad/pfghf.pdf

HOAS: Higher order abstract syntax (intuitionistic)
  http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~chad/hoas/pfghoas.pdf

The Egal theory is the default theory.
To use the Mizar theory, use the -mizar command line argument.
To use the HF theory, use the -hf command line argument.
To use the HOAS theory, use the -hoas command line argument.

Examples for each theory are in

examples/egal
examples/mizar
examples/hf
examples/hoas

See examples/README for more information about the examples.
